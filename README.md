# OVERVIEW
The aim of this project is to evaluate and compare the performance of five well-known classification techniques for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using sensor data gathered from cell phones. The project seeks to determine which algorithm achieves the highest accuracy in categorizing various human motions and activities, thereby providing insights for the development of more precise and effective HAR systems.
